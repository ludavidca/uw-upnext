The individuals who oversee these responsibilities are the 7 executives and their subteams who devote themselves each term to be at your beck and call.

Please welcome the new executives for Fall 2024 - may Allah inspire sincerity in their hearts, hikmah in their decisions, success in their actions, and enable prosperity to the community through them ü§≤
