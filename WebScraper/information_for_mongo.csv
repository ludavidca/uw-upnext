First things first- our Board goes on a retreat 🏝️This is where they learn some of the skills they will need to help advocate for their stakeholders (aka you🫵). Some topics covered at this year’s retreat include job responsibilities, budgeting, and an overview of WUSA services. 

After this retreat, all the board members participated in media training 📸 While Nick and Arya are the primary spokespeople for WUSA, all members are trained on how to best communicate with students and others on socials. 

During this time there have also been 3 monthly Board meetings. To watch the full meetings, head to our YouTube or check out the articles at wusa.ca. For a quick recap, check out our Reels page for ‘what you missed at the Board meeting in under 60 seconds”. 

Going forward, the Board will focus on the annual plan and the budget for the 2024-2025 year. After that, they will tackle the 5-year plan for 2025-2030, which will set the organization’s direction for the next 5 years.
